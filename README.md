# Mob Coding

A mob programming web app for real-time collaboration at in-person events. The goal is to make the most of meetups/classes where a group of people with laptops are all sitting together in a room!

## Project Goals

**Goals for Version 1.0.0:**

- Just a turn-based, collaborative plain text box!
- Countdown timer displays the remaining for each player and resets after each turn
- Players can enter their name or stay anonymous
- List of active players shows their names, highlights whose turn it is
- App displays who has the current turn, and who has the next turn
- App gets the user's attention somehow when it's their turn and when their turn is next
- Tools: NodeJS, Express, SocketIO, plain vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS
